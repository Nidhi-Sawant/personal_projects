A repository for my personal data analysis, data science, data engineering projects.
1. Osteoporosis disease detection system: 1000+ X-ray images passed through a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model, to be classified into 5 categories to predict severity of osteoporosis. Consists data pre-processing, handling missing values, Model Optimization with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques. Deployed on google colab.
2. Health Insurance Analysis: Comprehensive health insurance analysis, including data imputation techniques, feature engineering, and correlation analysis. Developed and evaluated Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor models, interpreting model performance through metrics like RMSE.
3. IPL Data Analysis: Historical IPL data analysed using PySpark and sparks SQL. Conducted Data ingestion, transformation, analysis, visualization, with Apache Sparks. Deployed on Databricks. (tutorial based project for learning purposes).
